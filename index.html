                I’m so sorry for the words I said that hurt you. I realize now that I didn’t fully understand what
                you were going through, and I wish I had been there for you the way you needed me. I promise I will
                never hurt you like that again. Your happiness means everything to me, and I want to see you smile
                every single day. I may not always know exactly what you’re feeling, but I want you to know that I am 
                always with you, through everything.<br><br>

                Sometimes I react or speak without thinking, and I might say things I don’t truly mean. Please forgive
                me for those moments. All I want is to be with you, to support you, and to love you forever. I want us 
                to be together, always. 😔❤️
