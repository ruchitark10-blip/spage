        <p>Hey Akash!
            I’m so sorry for the words I said that hurt you. I realize now that I didn’t fully understand what
            you were going through, and I wish I had been there for you the way you needed me. I promise I will
            never hurt you like that again. Your happiness means everything to me, and I want to see you smile
            every single day. I may not always know exactly what you’re feeling, but I want you to know that I am
            always with you, through everything.<br><br>

            Sometimes I react or speak without thinking, and I might say things I don’t truly mean. Please forgive
            me for those moments. All I want is to be with you, to support you, and to love you forever. I want us
            to be together, always.
            ~ Your's Rucha❤️
        </p>
